# Current Dev State

Branch: v2.6.0-asr-engines

Current focus:
- Local ASR engine testing and Auto Quality selection.
- Accuracy is priority over speed.
- Clear/common speech should not be silently accepted if wrong.
- Weak ASR output should stay marked as draft or be rejected by threshold.

Important context:
- Python GUI already has Transcript tab, local ASR dialog, Auto Probe 30s, Self-Test 15s, linked media, waveform/timeline work, and ASR warning export.
- There is no separate asr_hardware.py file. Hardware/environment detection currently lives in asr_quality_policy.py.
- whisper.cpp Vulkan works on AMD RX 5700 through C:\whisper.cpp.
- Manual matrix result: large-v3 phrase prompt is best quality; large-v3-turbo is faster but weaker on important terms.
- Topic resolver / Common Crawl / Serper / Exa are later background glossary helpers only. They are not ASR engines and must be strict-filtered.

Command style preference:
- Do not put multiple separate CMD commands in one copy block.
- Avoid repeating cd/venv activation when already in the project venv.
- Prefer one large Python patch/update file over many manual code edits.
